<h1 class="heading">The Glory of God: The Power of our Power</h1>
<p class="summary">Dr. Bryan Chapell of Covenant Theological Seminary preaches on the glory of God from Isaiah 6:1-8:</p>
<p class="scripture">In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:</p>
<p class="scripture">
    &#34;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;
    the whole earth is full of his glory!&#34;</p>
<p class="scripture">
    And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: &#34;Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!&#34;</p>
<p class="scripture">
    Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: &#34;Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.&#34;</p>
<p class="scripture">
    And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &#34;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&#34; Then I said, &#34;Here I am! Send me.&#34;<span class="reference">(Isaiah 6:8 ESV)</span>
