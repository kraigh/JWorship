<h1 class="heading">Summary</h1>
<p class="summary indent">Darrin Patrick introduces the summer worship series with "All of Life is Worship".</p>
<p class="summary indent">Worship is a response to God's mercy that moves us from being conformed by the world to being transformed by the Holy Spirit.  C.S. Lewis writes that  "It is in the process of being worshiped that God communicates His presence to men." As we see in Romans 12:1-2, worship is holistic and all-encompassing; all of life is worship.  Whether we're serving our neighbors, resisting temptation, or coming together to praise God corporately, all is an acknowledgment that he has called us out of darkness into his marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9) and that he is worthy of our praise.</p>

<h1 class="heading">Scripture:</h1>
<p class="scripture indent">I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. <span class="reference">(Romans 12:1-2 ESV)</span>
